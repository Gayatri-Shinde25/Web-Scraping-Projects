# Web-Scraping-Projects

## Project Overview: Web Scraping Amazon and Top End Sports Websites

The objective of this project is to perform web scraping on the Amazon website and the Top End Sports website. For Amazon, the goal is to extract detailed product information such as titles, prices, ratings, reviews, and availability. This data can be used to monitor price changes and availability for specific products, providing insights for trends, competitive pricing, and market analysis. For Top End Sports, the focus is on collecting data from sports articles, training guides, equipment reviews, and athlete profiles. This includes extracting detailed information on various sports, fitness regimes, and performance tips, allowing for the aggregation and analysis of data to gain insights into sports trends and popular training methods.

To achieve these objectives, we will utilize Python as the primary programming language. The libraries and frameworks employed will include BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and extracting data, Scrapy for scalable and robust web scraping, and Selenium for handling dynamic content and JavaScript-rendered pages. Data manipulation and analysis will be done using Pandas, while Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used for data visualization. For storage, we will use CSV/Excel for simple data storage, SQLite/MySQL for structured and relational data storage, and MongoDB for unstructured or semi-structured data. Scheduling and automation will be managed with Cron jobs or Task Scheduler for periodic scraping and Airflow for workflow automation.
